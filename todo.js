//////////////////////////////////
//  FLOWY BALLOON LIFTER todo   //
//////////////////////////////////

//- Gut out ballon bobble mechanics
//- remove ceiling on level 
//- balloon, chain and item carried on chain for every breath
	//- change balloon so it anchors to an item
	//- item is just small obstacle for now 
		//- will need to retrofit obstacle class
//- do we still use anchor and chain?
//- or do ballons stay in place in center until released?
	//- using anchor and chain means we can prototype it faster

//- fix clean up after breath so it only destroys correct chain. 
//- make lower chain invisible


- Add new breathIndicator
- allow for hold cycles 
- abstract grabbing item so you can press anywhere on screen (see cloudbreaker)
- Add lanes for VERY basic gameplay
	//- reduce balloon colors to 2 
	//- add 2 sensor entities
	//- add collision rules to check if right balloon is going through
	- put 'perfect!' text in place if it is
	- add reward text entity 
	- grab sprite sheet from cloudbreaker
	- reward accordingly
